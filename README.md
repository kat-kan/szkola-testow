# szkola-testow

## purpose

This repository documents code written during course "Szkoła Testów" (en. School of unit tests, [course](https://szkolatestow.online/) by Aleksandra Kunysz). 
All of the code in this repository was written by me. 

## module 1
Module 1 covers basics of unit testing - why do we even want to write unit tests and how we should think about them. It shows how to write first unit test (with and without JUnit).

### module 1 homework
The task was to create basic string calculator (based on the pseudocode given) and write few unit tests. 

## module 2
Module 2 is all about helpful tools - JUnit, AssertJ, Mockito, IDE shortcuts. It explains what is the goal of stubbing/mocking.
