# szkola-testow

## purpose

This repository documents code written during course "Szkoła Testów" (en. School of unit tests, [course](https://szkolatestow.online/) by Aleksandra Kunysz). 
All of the code in this repository was written by me. 

## module 1
Module 1 covers basics of unit testing - why do we even want to write unit tests and how we should think about them. It shows how to write first unit test (with and without JUnit).

### module 1 homework
The task was to create basic string calculator (based on the pseudocode given) and write few unit tests. 

## module 2
Module 2 is all about helpful tools - JUnit, AssertJ, Mockito, IDE shortcuts. It explains what is the goal of stubbing/mocking.

### module 2 homework
- Part 1: The task was to create VatService app (based on the pseudocode given) and write unit tests. 
- Part 2 : Provide VAT with VatProvider interface and stub it in the tests. 
- Part 3 (for volunteers only) : Add logger with different levels to VatService. Adjust tests so they use only mocks. 

## module 3
Module 3 shows concept of TDD, BDD, ATDD (focuses mostly on TDD). It mentions some practices to polish the programming skills - katas, pair programming, coding dojo.

### module 3 homework
- Part 1 : Watch a video with TDD solution to a kata then try to solve it on your own.
- Part 2 (for volunteers only) : Try to solve another kata using TDD.
